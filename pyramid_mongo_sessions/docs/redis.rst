Redis Notes
===========

Installing Redis
----------------

The best place to start is the Redis `quick start guide <http://redis.io/topics/quickstart>`_.

If you need automated deployment with your application, you can find guides
online for Redis deployment via buildout, puppet, chef, etc. If anyone would
like to compile a list of recipes for these deployment options, I wholly
encourage pull requests with links.

Discussions of Redis security are outside the purview of these docs, but it's
worth noting that Redis will listen on all interfaces by default, potentially
exposing your data to the world. You can avoid this with a bind declaration in
your redis.conf file such as::

    bind 127.0.0.1


You can read more in a blog post discussing this issue `here

Why Redis?
----------

Redis is fast, widely deployed, and stable. It works best when your data can
fit in memory, but is configurable and still quite fast when you need to sync
to disk. There are plenty of existing benchmarks, opinion pieces, and articles
if you want to learn about its use cases. But for `pyramid_redis_sessions`, I'm
interested in it specifically for these reasons:

* it really is bleeping fast (choose your own expletive)
* it has a very handy built-in mechanism for setting expirations on keys
* the watch mechanism is a nice, lightweight alternative to full transactions
* session data tends to be important but not mission critical, but if it is...
* it has configurable `persistence <http://redis.io/topics/persistence>`_
