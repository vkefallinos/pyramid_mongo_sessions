pyramid_redis_sessions
======================
This package provides a fast and stable implementation of Pyramid's `ISession
interface <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/interfaces.html#pyramid.interfaces.ISession>`_,
using Redis as its backend.

Special thanks to Chris McDonough for the original idea, inspiration, and some
borrowed code.


When to Use Redis for Sessions
==============================

Persistent session stores are ideal when you want server side sessions and a
clean separation of concerns (your code doesn't need to know details as long as
it knows how to talk to the server). Redis expands on these benefits by giving
us:

* built-in key expiration to automatically clean up expired session data
* no need for complicated/unpredictable lock handling in our python code
* a lightweight alternative to full transactions (the watch mechanism)


When Not to Use Redis for Sessions
==================================

Redis makes a compelling case for session data, but as with any technology
decision it's important to be aware of the trade-offs. Adding Redis to your
stack can mean:

* time spent installing, configuring, and maintaining a Redis instance
* speed before consistency (Redis is fast at the cost of syncing *eventually*)
* the entirety of your session data must fit in memory

Typically these aren't concerns for sessions, because critical data doesn't
usually belong in a client session. However, in specialized cases where you need
consistency at the cost of speed, you may consider database-backed
sessions using a proven database server like
`PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_.

Alternatively, if you only ever store less than ~4kb of non-sensitive
data, cookie-based sessions work nicely without requiring you to add complexity
to your stack.
